# 📝 Diary Sentiment Analysis Model
A machine learning model designed to analyze the sentiment of diary-style text entries. This model helps users understand their emotional tone over time by classifying entries as positive, negative, or neutral.

📌 Features
🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) based sentiment classification

🧪 Trained on real-life journal/diary datasets and/or augmented datasets

📊 Outputs sentiment label and optional confidence score

📈 Helpful for mood tracking, journaling apps, mental wellness analysis, etc.
